* 30-45 minutes
* Focus:
    * ask questions, let the user guide you
    * no wrong answers
    * Fun and...a bit challenging too
* Selected from survey, personal connections, recommendations
* People across domains and experience levels

# Rust is an enabler

>Rust is more of a one-stop-tool that you can actually learn it and then use it for other purposes, like embedded, android, web services, and other stuff.

<pre></pre>

>This is language that will just make me stop thinking about using C and Python. So I just have to use Rust because then I can go as low as possible as high as possible.

<pre></pre>

>I was civil engineering and I studied from the front-end my own, self taught. I had no computer background. I got interested in Rust and distributed systems and designs and systems around it. I changed my major I studied CS and Rust at the same time.

# Rust makes you a better programmer

>this will make you a better programmer in those other languages

<pre></pre>

>...you start to look at your old code in a different light...it made me question a lot of code that I had thought was rock solid - things that you really hang your hat on. It made me question a lot of that stuff.

<pre></pre>

>...it's been very interesting to learn this very unique way of programming, I think it is the future

# Rust is *fun*

>Feeling cool gives a lot of difference... the feeling of I'm writing the language that is considered super cool, makes it feel like playing a game, it's not work anymore

<pre></pre>

>I love Rust with all my heart...I don't think I've seen anyone that loves JavaScript the way Rust developers love Rost. Even in the community, they are obsessed with it.

<pre></pre>

>Rust is a language for people. It's humanentric in that kind of sense...it has always been obvious that that's been an intent rather than an accident... it's still I think one of the best communities I've come across.
